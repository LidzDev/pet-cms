# Cat Sitting
You've been tasked with making a booking system for a catsitter. The catsitter wants to allow her regular local clients to book catsitting visits via an online interface.

## MVP
A 'Client' needs to be able to enter and update their name and address (street, postcode) and information about their 'Cat's (name, age) and dates they would like to book 'Visits' for. The Catsitter needs to be able to add new clients and delete clients she does not want to work with anymore.

## Extensions
- The client needs to be able to add special instructions for dealing with their cats
- The client needs to be able to add instructions on how to gain access to the building / handover keys.
- The client would like to indicate whether the cats should be visited once or twice per day
- The catsitter would like to be able to register whether or not a visit booked by a client is accepted.
- The catsitter would like to have a list of visits she needs to make so that she can plan her round.
- The catsitter would like to keep track of catsitting visits she has provided.
- The catsitter would like to keep track of how much she should charge each client (flat rate of 10 GBP per visit)

## Advanced Extensions
- The catsitter would like to publish available booking slots
