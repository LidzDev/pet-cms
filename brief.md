# Cat Sitting
You've been tasked with making a booking system for a catsitter. The catsitter wants to allow her regular local clients to book catsitting visits via an online interface.

## MVP
A 'Client' needs to be able to enter and update their name and address (street, postcode) and information about their 'Pet's (name, age) and dates they would like to create a 'Booking' for. The Catsitter needs to be able to add new clients and delete clients she does not want to work with anymore. The Catsitter needs to be able to see a list of visits.

## Extensions
- GDPR means that the client needs to be able to delete their data so that the catsitting CMS is legally compliant
- The client needs to be able to add special instructions for dealing with their cats so that they get correct care
- The client needs to be able to add instructions on how to gain access to the building / handover keys so that the cats can actually be visited.
- The client would like to indicate whether the cats should be visited once or twice per day
- The client would like to be able to see the visits they have booked
- The client would like to be able to cancel a visit
- The catsitter would like to be able to register whether or not a visit booked by a client is accepted.
- The catsitter would like to see a list of upcoming visits(not yet done)
- The catsitter would like to keep track of catsitting visits she has provided.
- The catsitter would like to keep track of how much she should charge each client (flat rate of 10 GBP per visit)

## Advanced Extensions
- The catsitter would like to publish available booking slots
- The catsitter would like to add a page for prospective clients to the website
